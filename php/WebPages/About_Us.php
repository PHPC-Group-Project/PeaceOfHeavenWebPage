            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>-POH Pet Care is built for Beau, Bronx, our buddy Brody-who has crossed the rainbow bridge, and all dogs in between.</p>
            <p>-No matter how much we would like our dogs to go with us wherever we go, sometimes it just is not possible. We have always struggled to leave them behind. Brody was gentle & laid-back but always had a medical need & required special attention.  Beau would not do well in a typical boarding environment. And Bronx, well, she would be the vocal one in the group causing more chaos.  In talking with others, we realized many face this same challenge. We decided to create the space we needed…a little “peace of heaven” for pet owners inspired by our own three dogs and what we desire for them.</p>
            <p>-POH is designed to accommodate sensitive dogs like Beau, social dogs like Bronx, and extra care dogs like Brody while still being able to incorporate all the exercise, play, stimulation, and bonding time needed.</p>
